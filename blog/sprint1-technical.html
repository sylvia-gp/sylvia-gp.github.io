      Welcome to my blog post demystifying the differences between inline, block and inline-block in CSS and exploring when and why you might use each. I'll be breaking each down into their individual properties with some images of my own exploration to aid in comprehension. The first thing that's important to understand is that every HTML element works on what's called a 'box model'. This means you can set specific parameters to create more space around the element and other elements, the element and it's border and the content of the element within other elements. When I talk about 'margins' and 'padding' I am referring to this box model style of organising elements. Hope this helps to explain some simple terms that look more convoluted than they really are!

      <h3>Display: inline</h3>
      Inline display basically means that it is 'inline' with the other HTML elements around it. The properties of the inline rule are as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>Your inline element can have margins and padding set for the sides, but margins and padding cannot be set for the top and bottom of the element.</li>
        <li>You cannot set the width or height of an inline element.</li>
        <li>Other HTML elements sit either side of an inline element.</li>
        <li>Inline elements do not create 'line breaks'. This means that other elements can nest directly either side of them without starting a new line.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>Display: block</h3>
      Block display is the default of many HTML elements and is extremely easy to manipulate using the box-model due to the following properties:
      <ul>
        <li>Block display respects all set margins and paddings on all sides of your HTML elements. It will not overlap in any way with another element.</li>
        <li>A 'line break' is forced after a block element, meaning the next element will start on the next line.</li>
        <li>If the width is not defined then a block element will take up the full width available.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
