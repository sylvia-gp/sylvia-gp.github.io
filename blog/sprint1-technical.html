    <h2>Display: Inline vs Inline-block</h2>

      Welcome to my blog post demystifying the differences between inline, block and inline-block in CSS and exploring when and why you might use each. I'll be breaking each down into their individual properties with some images of my own exploration to aid in comprehension. Hope this helps to explain some simple terms that look more convoluted than they really are!

      Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the journey over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. On reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia.

      While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted stealing the kai (food). He was immediately recognised.
