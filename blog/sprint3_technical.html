            <h2>HTML and CSS, friends for life</h2>    
        <p>HTML and CSS are close friends that strengthen each other in a number of ways. I like to think of HTML as a pizza and CSS as the sauces and herbs. Our HTML base sets up the size, shape and general flavours of the delicious web pizza we're designing. You wanna get your topping classes sorted here and get your cheesy paragraphs all ready to go. But a pizza with no sauce is.. well.. dry. So CSS is ready to swoop in and customise some more precise flavours, add a little flare and sauce up your already-delicious content with a little more fine-tuning than your sweet base and toppings can do themselves. Effectively CSS adds textures, flavours and differences so that even with the exact same toppings you can still customise your pizza experience for each pizza you make. Delicious!</p>
        <h2>Control flow - Makes things sensible</h2>
        <p>Everybody has an order that they get dressed in when they're not thinking about it. It might differ depending on whether it's cold, whether you're already wearing PJS, whether you plan to leave the house etc, but there are a few things that have to be done in a certain order for them to work (eg, pants before underwear !== success..). This is an excellent analogy for Control Flow. While there are some clothes that you will always need to prioritise, control flow is the process you go through to take in all the variables of the day and use them to decide what order you'll need to dress in to stay warm, look cool and appear like you know what you're doing. Just like dressing for success, control flow can take a little practice to get everything in the right place in the right way but the effect is that you have a smooth, sensible and cohesive outfit and everybody is very impressed.</p>
        <h2>Enter the ThunderDOM</h2>
        <p>I'm not sure about everyone else but I find the words 'The DOM' just a little bit intimidating. In practice however it's really a lot more practical and useful than it is anything else. DOM stands for Document Object Model, which really just means that it represents HTML documents by organising the elements into objects. What does that mean? They can be manipulated much more quickly and directly, and can be modified directly using different scripting languages! The DOM turns an HTML document into a tree structure that visually divides all the aspects of your contents into a lovely clear flow. Because these are divided up they can then be called directly into any new scripting documents you might want to use to alter your HTML code directly. This means direct, visual alteration of any elements you're wanting to change, right in the browser window. If you're a visual person this is a game changer for figuring out what it is you're doing. To help understand what this means; imagine you need to change your name and flee the country for totally legal reasons. Your blog is covered with your old name, your old address and photos of your house that's definitely not a crime house. The DOM will allow you to quickly find and replace every instance of your old name with your new one, delete every instance of your old adrdress with one instruction and replace all your incriminating photos with a sleepy kitten. Now you're off to Hawaii to live your glorious new life, with time for a wine at the airport. Thanks DOM!</p>
        <h2>Arrays vs Objects</h2>
        <p>Arrays and objects are both lists of information stored within a larger catchment. However, like dolphins and whales; all arrays are objects, but not all objects are arrays. This means that arrays have a few more specific properties than your run-of-the-mill object. Arrays are extremely useful for storing numbers and values that are of the same type (strings with strings etc), as their calling processes are quick, specific and based around the array being a relatively straight-forward list. Objects have a greater amount of versatility and are more useful for more complicated lists of info, they are great for grouping specific sections of multi-layer data-structures. Need to keep track of all the ages of your friends for quick access because of your bad memory? An array is perfect; easy to access and call and designed for quick-list access. Wanna keep track of their ages, favourite things, music tastes and specific locations? An object is going to give you more access to change this info quickly, access only the particular info you need at any time and increase readability. Stalking your friends will never be more efficient.</p>
        <h2>Functions - They're functional</h2>
        <p>Functions are one of the most useful and fundamental aspects of javascript (also, objects!). A function is a block of code that is set up for performing a specific task. This task is generally performed when something activates it, a specific condition or time is given to the function so that it will run it's little package of info exactly when you want it to. They can also be handed 'values', which is info that helps them to perform the task required in slightly more specific ways. The end product of a function is to return a value so unless asked to return that value then a function will always return 'undefined'. Just like if you send out a wedding invitation without an RSVP request. How many meals do you need? You'll never know. A well-made function will give you a clear value, at the time and place you request, with the capacity to change the result depending on what values you offer to it. In this way, they are better than most wedding guests.</p>
