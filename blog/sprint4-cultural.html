        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <p>
            Neuroplasticity is still a relatively young science so the possibilites of how it can benefit people are still evolving, which is pretty exciting! Understanding neuroplasticity is useful because it is an understanding that your brain is not a fixed object with a certain make-up based on random events outside your control. When you know that you are capable of strengthening neural pathways simply by thinking or acting in certain ways, you can begin to encourage and stimulate growth in the directions you want to. This open doorways for anybody who feels like they are fundamentally unable to achieve certain things, especially when it comes to education and learning new skills. When you understand that strong neural pathways are built by making small changes and repeating them frequently then it's much easier to believe that time and practice are what stand in your way, not the genetic lottery. That's pretty empowering stuff for anybody.

            As somebody with ADHD there is nothing about the idea of neuroplasticity that I don't find useful. My study life has been littered with comments about my lack of focus, my loudness, my inability to memorise information for any length of time. These things start to take root in the brain like benchmarks of inability and begin to put you off trying new things or working longer at things that are hard at first. Understanding that I have the capacity to strengthen my own areas of weakness and shape my own learning simply by doing it regularly it is not only empowering, it's life-altering.

            Things that increase neuroplasticity are often things that are generally advisable for a healthier life anyway; things like getting 7-9 hours of sleep a night, staying well hydrated and eating foods that fuel and power your brain. Leafy greens, nuts and dark chocolate all have brain-boosting properties that can help with brain health, in turn helping with neural pathway changes. But other useful activities include life-long learning, stress reduction and reading books. Learning new things helps your brain stay in shape just like physical exercise helps your body stay in shape (physical exercise is ALSO good for the brain, increasing oxygen flow and brain volume, yay!). Reading fiction not only strengthens your creativity and imagination, it also helps reduce stress, which inhibits learning and brain power significantly. Staying healthy and happy is a surefire way to make sure your brain is working at capacity and you are learning in your optimal state.

            A resource I found useful and informative was the article on neuroplasticity at https://positivepsychology.com/neuroplasticity/ - Not only is the article extremely comprehensive, there's also a great range of extra resources at the bottom including videos, TED talks and book reccomendations.

        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p>
            Growth mindset is essentially the practice of understanding and believing in neuroplasticity. It's committing to the idea that instead of having fixed intelligence or capacity for knowledge, you can shape and grow through concerted and continued effort. By providing students with a growth mindset we are able to provide them with a greater belief in themselves, meaning that they are more resilient against challenges and get more enjoyment from their learning. Happier students are inevitably smarter students!

            This exploration made perfect sense to me as somebody who was raised in a Montessori learning environment. The Montessori philosophy revolves around the idea that each individual student is able to achieve highly when allowed to learn in their own way and at their own pace, which in my opinion reflects the idea of a growth mindset strongly. Reading through resources about the growth mindset style of teaching feels a bit like reading through the scientific reasoning behind why montessori was such a good learning environment for me growing up. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been incorporating growth mindset into my learning journey by reminding myself that every day is a new day for greater engagement, growth and learning. By committing fully to the process of learning something almost entirely new it means that even when I hit a point that I struggle with greatly, it's just a moment in a forwards-moving journey and getting past it will increase my capacity to get past more blocks in the future.

            I found the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75GFzikmRY0 - 'Growth Mindset Introduction: What it is, How it Works, and Why it Matters' quite useful and comprehensive resource.
        </p>

            My learning plan and strategy were developed with these ideas in mind so it won't change drastically from this point. It does however reinforce my commitment to making sure I check back in with my learning plan regularly and continue to move forward with these ideas in mind.
