         After collecting a wide range of feedback and quite a bit of self-reflection it's becoming clearer to me that my core personal values centre strongly around people, nature emotions and experiences. My family is extremely important to me, as are my friends and inevitably my co-workers quickly join those groups too. It's important to me to build people up, make them feel heard and create the best environment for them to be the best they can be. Kindness and compassion are at the heart of all my decision-making, often putting myself on the backburner to help those around me.

         I used to work at Wellington Zoo where my job was as a Visitor Ranger, somebody who bridges the gap between animals and people and educates visitors. One part of the job was doing talks about the animals, often with feeds or enrichment demonstrations. One of the talks I did often was the chimp talk which involved throwing apples to the chimps while talking over a mic to large and varied groups of visitors about our troop and chimp behaviours. Unfortunately the upper deck of the visitor seating area had struts that stuck out a little lower than visitors sometimes expected and during a talk of mine a man walked into one of them and gave himself a large (but superficial) head wound. Blood went everywhere. EVERYWHERE. Talks were set to run 15 minutes and we would often get complaints if they weren't up to the expectations of visitors, the zoo was quite strict on the style, flow and content of these talks and it was made clear to us that the person on talk was responsible for keeping everything going to schedule and in order. So I had a rapidly shrinking moment to decide whether it was my responsibility to look after this man (who's daughter was much more upset than he was), or keep my commitment to the other 30-40 people who had turned up to see the chimps fed and carry on with the talk. If I stopped I was sure to get complaints, which would lead to me being reprimanded by upper management, or I could keep going and receive complaints for not helping a man covered in blood who was trying his best to tell people he really was fine. The decision I made in the moment was to make a moment of it, explain to people that clearly there had been an accident and let them know that I was going to keep the mic on and show them what happened when these things occured at the zoo! I hopped on my radio and used some good solid radio call jargon to assess what other keepers were nearby, whether any of them had first-aid training and request assistance at the chimp park. Thankfully for me there was a first-aider at the lions who hopped down and took over the situation with the bleeding man while I was able to maintain control of the larger group, keeping them from panicking and keeping interest long enough that we were able to return to the talk and finish feeding the chimps as per the promised schedule. After the talk I got a lot of feedback directly from the group themselves about how well I'd handled the situation and how impressed they were by the professional way in which Wellington Zoo dealt with emergencies. My manager was pleased I'd managed to continue the talk and still put the needs of the large visitor group at the forefront of what could have been a disasterous situation. The family of the bleeding man was whisked away by the first aider, but they were extremely thankful for her care and kindness and I was beyond proud of my ability to delegate effectively in a tense moment. This was one of my proudest work moments, as I find ethical issues around the needs of individuals vs the needs of groups to be the hardest issues to tackle both fully compassionately and fully effectively.

         Culturally I identify as a proud New Zealander and Wellingtonian. I come from a background of Montessori education and a primary school with a full immersion Te Reo Maori strand. My parents are both NZ European, however I've never identified with my english or irish roots and actually find classic english culture somewhat offputting. Growing up in Wellington has influenced my identity strongly, I have a strong connection to nature because of the dense NZ bush I grew up surrounded by and I do think that loving Wellington fosters my values of inclusivity, equality and open-mindedness. My family prizes intellect highly which has influenced how I see my own education just as much as my Montessori upbringing did. I learnt to read before I began school and have always seen myself as somebody who picks up new ideas quickly, leading to a self-imposed responsibilty to help those around me to understand things I've already grasped. I spent a lot of my young life immersed in tikanga Maori which has hugely influenced my belief in the importance of people, people's stories, the value of community, our responsibilities to the world and people around us and the joy of manaakitanga. I have been fortunate in my life and loved in my life, which has led to a strong and healthy sense of self-worth and identity.

         My career and educational strengths centralise around a fairly strong belief in my own capabilites. I've always picked things up quickly, in primary school my teacher was frequently impressed by my ability to not only read storybooks to the class at length, but also read them upside down so the rest of the class could look at the pictures. My preschool teacher wrote in school reports that I exhibited 'strong leadership qualities early' which has been reflected over my career, I tend to step into leadership roles very quickly when I start a new job. I think this also largely comes down to my people skills, I am often described by those around me as a social chameleon who can make 'anybody feel special'. I enjoy pushing those around me to express themselves and take pride in their work just as much as I enjoy taking pride in my own achievements. When I asked some of my close friends about what kind of values they saw in me the words that came up the most often were drive, integrity, honesty and courage, words that I found quite humbling. As an ENFP I'm also strong in searching for creative solutions to problems and am at my happiest when able to work mostly autonomously, intuitively finding and completing work simply because it needs doing. I feel a strong connection with the quote from Maria Montessori; 'Never help a child with a task at which he feels he can succeeed.'

         On the flipside of that I struggle when working under somebody who wants to have a strong hand in my work and I struggle IMMENSELY under micro management. This has been one of my career limitations as I have clashed heads with a few managers in the past because of it. It has however been a strength in my tertiary learning journey. Another of my limitations is that I often need some kind of time pressure to springboard into work. When studying Costume Construction one of my tutors described me as a 'Dark Horse' and once told me that 'If I could put as much effort over an entire project as I did in the last month I'd be unstoppable', however I find it very difficult to build that motivation if I feel like there are more immediate demands on my time. My ENFP nature also means that I have a sensitive nature and can be rubbed the wrong way by criticism (or perceived criticism). I'm easily overwhelmed if I feel like I've let somebody down, and do find myself obsessing over inter-personal relationships if it feels like something has gone wrong. Because of this I respond better to people bringing my attention to mistakes rather than reprimanding me for them, my strong sense of self-expectation means I'm already going to feel bad about the whole thing and work to fix it in the future.

         I think my strong problem solving abilities, autonomous workstyle and strong communication and people-skills are going to be extremely useful over my learning journey with Dev Academy. The difficulty I have hearing criticism is something I deal with a lot better when I am more aware of it and the way that Dev Academy works as an educational institute has already started giving me tools to better handle how that might go. Strong communication is the strength that will support me through my aversion to micro-management and working with a new and diverse range of people will hopefully only strengthen my ability to set reasonable personal boundaries when working with people who work in a different way to me.

         Near the beginning of my working life I worked for many years as a part time Host at Te Papa in the childrens discovery areas. Part of the work included Storyplace; an hour of reading, dancing and learning with under 5's, often the best part of the job. Unfortunately during a restructure we lost our fabulous manager to higher up the ranks and she was replaced by a manager who was already doing a different job and didn't have as much time or love for Storyplace. While she was an excellent educator she seemingly didn't have a strength in early childhood and we struggled as a team to adjust to the newer, stricter, more 'education focused' style of presentation. At the time I genuinely believed that she just didn't have the skills yet to understand what a magical place storyplace was and how much it didn't need to change (I was quite young). My main strategies at the time were to simply carry on as normal and expect her to catch up as she spent some more time with littlies, and to treat her ideas as suggestions while incorporating my own ideas over the top of hers. Neither of these were well received! Looking back I now understand that she was new to the job and would have had her own idea and dream of what storyplace could possibly be. She was lacking the people skills to get the team on board to try a different way of doing things and instead isolated people by changing their jobs from under them, and in turn we were despondent and dismissive of what she had to say. If I could do it again now I would make more of a commitment to helping her understand that our team already had a culture and the approach she took might benefit from being a little different. Also that we all liked our jobs and the tension came from a new arrival who treated her team like they didn't know what they were doing. I have a stronger understanding now that rejecting somebody's ideas completely will only ever turn them off, and that carrying on as normal would have made her feel disempowered rather than inspired. I'm much more interested in being a bridge to understanding between differing opinions now than I was at the start of my working life.
