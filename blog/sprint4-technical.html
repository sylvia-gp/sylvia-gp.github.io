                    Problems, we all have them. Learning to code is a fast way to find acceptance in the fact there's always going to be another one. However it's when we learn to approach those problems in new and brilliant ways that we can really start to shine and build some serious resiliance to that feeling of being unmanageably stuck.

                    Take this exact blog post for example. Seemingly simple task; come up with a time I got blocked on a simple problem. Commence staring at a blank screen for ten minutes thinking about all the things I've been stuck on that have seemed less than simple. The longer I just sit and think about it, the larger the problem gets. So I tried something else, I wrote out the rest of my blog, then came back. Still stuck, I reflected on previous blog posts and looked at what I'd done when I got stuck on them. While reading through some of my previous blog posts I come up with the genius plan to write about being blocked on writing my blog. And here we are! How did I feel throughout? A bit restless and frustrated that nothing sprung to mind straight away. But what have we learnt? That taking a step back and looking at problems from another perspective can almost always help you think outside the box and come up with solutions that would not have been your first port of call.

                    So, problem solved! Elegantly though? Maybe not. So here's another story. I worked at Animates for a while, if you've never worked retail I assure you: it's another area where resiliance to constant problems is a skill more essential than being able to work a till. The definition of being stuck between a rock and a hard place is being in between an angry customer that wants a refund and a profit-focused supplier that definitely isn't going to give them one. One of these times popped up for me when I was the lone supervisor on a busy Saturday, one of the more dire days in a retail store. Our customer was furious over a broken dog toy, she had no receipt, she didn't know when she'd bought it but she wasn't leaving until it was sorted. So I asked my peers for help, one of my coworkers remembered her and we managed to find her receipt in the system. We checked the transaction history of the product and found there had been a few returns before, but the supplier wouldn't refund the store. However the store did have a certain number of apology gift vouchers to give to customers who'd been inconvenienced so to save calling the manager on a day off I made the call to simply return the product into the system, zero the sale and give her a gift voucher slightly higher than the value of the product she was returning. She left pleased, the day continued and the manager was more than happy to not have to have been involved. Although angry customers can be a stressful and upsetting time for any employee, I felt we learnt a little about thinking outside the box that day to reach a conclusion that works for as many people as possible.

                    Of course these are just a few problems and a few techniques, but here's a few problem solving techniques that I've been learning about over the past few weeks:
            </p>
            <p>
                    Psuedocode:
                    Psuedocode is a technique I'm finding myself using more and more as I get further into javascript. There's a few nuanced ways of using it out there in the world of online forums, however as a basic technique for getting your thoughts in order it's a winner for sure. Looking at an empty screen is a surefire way to become overwhelmed, so even a few lines of basic psuedocode can make a big difference to getting started and building that confidence.
            </p>
            <p>
                    Trying something:
                    A classic! Probably my most-used technique is typing some things that might work in and seeing what happens. As I'm still in the early stages of my coding journey my attempts are not always rewarded with success, however trying things that fail over and over is a really great way to build some resiliance. Also when they do work you feel even better about your success!
            </p>
            <p>
                    Rubber ducky method:
                    Talking through your problem aloud with an eager ear is a great way to figure out where the area of issue might be. My 'rubber ducky' is a Flareon and we've solved a few blocks together simply by going back through the steps again in a descriptive way. It's also a great way to figure out where your areas of knowledge may not be quite as strong as you might have thought..
            </p>
            <p>
                    Reading error messages:
                    This technique gets more and more useful with every error message I see (thank goodness; I've seen a few of them by now). Error messages can look pretty intimidating when you first start encountering them but there's a lot of really useful info in there. Once you start to recognise some of the more common error prompts it can save you a lot of time trying to figure out where you went wrong, especially when it's just a matter of rearranging your syntax. There's also very few error messages that haven't been queried by another developer somewhere online, it's often worth the effort to look.
            </p>
            <p>
                    Console.logging:
                    A technique I'm confident in just as long as I know what it is I'm logging. Console logging is extremely useful when you want to check the output of what you're trying to do, however I do find it limited sometimes for a beginner if you're not a hundred per cent on what it is you're trying to assess the value of. That being said, I log my return values pretty often and have found it very helpful. 
            </p>
            <p>
                    Googling:
                    If there is a better problem solving technique for studying web development I haven't found it. Just about anything you might need to know more about it is a google search away. Googling is useful for error messages, finding built-in methods, working out syntax, re-discovering basics you might have forgotten, and a million more things. The main roadblock for googling lies around needing to know in advance what it is you want to google, but the problem solving technique of 'trying something' comes in useful there. So far google has been the main provider of just about all of my javascript need-to-know-how and I am extremely thankful for it.

            <p>
                    Asking your peers for help:
                    This is something I might get more use out of once I'm doing a bit more on-site programming. When working remotely it's just as quick to google a problem as it is to type it into a Slack channel, and google's not let me down yet. Although since a lot of my googling leads to forums of programmers discussing what I'm trying to work out, I suppose they sort of go hand in hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                    Asking coaches for help:
                    See above! Once bootcamp begins and we're spending more time on-site then the use of asking another real human person for help is going to go up quite a lot. To this point, I've not had any issues so complex that I need to discuss my specific issue with somebody else.
            </p>
            <p>
                    Improving the process with reflection:
                    This is a double-edged sword for me in a way. Reflection is great for solidifying knowledge, highlighting areas of weaker knowledge and reinforcing what you've done well. However as a chronic over-thinker it can also create a bit of turmoil around whether I've done enough or can even convince me that I need to go back and re-do work. Herein madness lies, so I keep reflection as brief, light and positive as I can to avoid accidentally convincing myself that I only made mistakes.
