               Here we are at the end of Sprint 5! My goodness, what a journey so far. With bootcamp just around the corner I find myself reflecting naturally back on the last five weeks and what they've meant to be, but this blog entry involves some of my core-specific musings.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've learnt a lot about myself not just through core but through the entire foundations process, but three things that really stick out for me are the following: <br>
                Turns out that once I put my mind to something, I'm dedicated as all hell. There have been some times over the past five weeks that have been harder than others, often due to personal reasons, and I've worked hard to make sure I had a plan for how to make sure they impacted my work as little as possible. When I couldn't be at my computer, I downloaded coding apps to practice on my phone. If I wasn't up to learning new things for the day, I spent my time revising old learning. I'm extremely proud of the time and effort I've put in over the past five weeks, and strive to continue with a high level of dedication into bootcamp.<br>
                I've learnt that I struggle a bit with online communities. I'm not a huge facebook user, I've never had a twitter and my instagram is only really to look at wildlife photos. I found posting my blog posts and hard work to an online forum full of people I've never met a pretty hard task and actually often ended up a bit anxiety-induced. I find people are often different online than they are in person and feel like I will be much more comfortable sharing my work with people at bootcamp than I have been just through a screen.<br>
                I've also had to take a bit of a look at the way I write over the span of foundations. It's been about four years since I had to submit anything written and it turns out it isn't quite like riding a bike. I've discovered that I enjoy semi-creative writing a lot more than any kind of formal writing and my enjoyment of the writing tasks has gone up steadily since the beginning of Foundations.

                What surprised me the most was initially how hard I found it. I really identify with a lot of the core materials. I've come from a Montessori learning background with open-minded parents and a strong childhood connection with the values of manaakitanga, a lot of which resonate strongly with the values represented in Core. So I was surprised when I found myself sitting at the computer, looking at briefs and not really knowing what to say. However, struggling helped me lean a bit further into the whole process and has actually helped me connect more strongly with the Core material than I might have if it had been a total breeze.

                The most challenging aspect for me was definitely sharing my work with a large group of strangers. When I try and look at work I've done through the eyes of somebody who might be completely different to me, I start to question my own work. I've always considered myself a people-person so this anxiety around sharing my work was pretty unexpected. I'd never considered that there would be a difference between sharing my work with a room full of people and sharing it with a chatroom full of people. The former is definitely still a stronger place for me.

                So why do it? This is how I see it. It's about resiliance. Programming can be extremely frustrating sometimes. Things don't always work how you want them to. But your resiliance to these hard times, your ability to bounce back with grace and kindness even when you make mistakes and your capacity for strong communication are all going to make that road a heck of a lot easier. Also I've been in the workforce a while now and I've seen more than a few non-core-value employees run amok in a team. Nobody wants to work with an egotistical maniac or an angry, bitter loner, so why would anybody want to hire them?

                Was it all a waste of time? Of course not. Understanding yourself in the workplace is a valuable skill, problem solving is an essential skill, communication and kind feedback and self-awareness are wonderful life-skills. There were certainly times when I was more excited about the next thing we were doing in Tech than I was in doing Core and I even found parts of it a bit confronting, but it was never a waste of time and I've learnt some really valuable things.
