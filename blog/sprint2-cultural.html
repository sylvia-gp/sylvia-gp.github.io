            <h2>Bootcamp</h2>
            <p>
                My long term goals still revolve around working my way to team management and being able to have a little flexibility in my work schedule. Once I leave Dev Academy I'd love to work ideally in a supportive work environment with down to earth and like-minded people. I dream of working in an office with windows that let in real sunlight and where I could potentially grow some indoor plants at my desk. The impact I'd like to make involves being a supportive teammate as well as a valued employee, I'd like to work hard but also have time for people. I don't really have a specific destination in mind however.

            <p>
                I have a feeling that a lot of my strengths around people-skills will be much more useful in bootcamp than I've found them in foundations. I think my strong ability in creative problem solving is going to be super beneficial, as well as my new-found strength for weekly planning and my overall resilience to making mistakes. I'm really looking forward to face-to-face presentations over online submission too. However my weaknesses around close management may become an issue if required to work with a fellow cohort member who may have exceptionally strong opinions about the directions of our combined work, or is highly critical. I also have a bit of a tendency to over-focus, which may be harder to manage in a social environment, and an imposter syndrome/a lack of confidence in my own work at times that I will be working extremely hard to overcome.

            <p>
                My biggest non-technical challenge however, is probably going to be the length of the working days. I have struggled with 9-5 in the past, and I understand that this will be even more work than that. At home I am able to take breaks on my own time, work harder on days when my focus and attention are at their prime, and eat whenever I'm hungry. As somebody with ADHD I struggle at times to sit for long periods and I currently have quite a lot of nervousness around the amount of prolonged concentration that I potentially am going to have to maintain
            </p>
            <p>
                I'd like to use my time in bootcamp to develop a bit more communication skill when it comes to feeling overwhelmed or pushed too hard by other people. Setting reasonable personal boundaries kindly and clearly is something I have struggled with in the past, but with the amount of work we're going to be doing with other people it's something I'm going to be concentrating on quite a bit. When working in a team I'd like to find a solid balance between staying in the background and not putting forward my own ideas and not steam rolling other people to get my point through. It's a work in progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                Facilitator support to me looks like being present, friendly and accessible if needed, but not constantly checking over students shoulders. I understand support to be understanding that each student is on their own individual learning journey and that some students will work differently to others, having compassion for students differing emotional requirements and some flexibility around the way they may need to learn.
            </p>
            <p>
                My expectations for myself revolve around turning up and being fully present every day of bootcamp. In order to achieve this in the most productive and safe way posible I plan to: Keep an eye on the length of time I am working and take suitable amounts of walking breaks, communicate when I am struggling with those around me in a clear and helpful way, hold myself to account for things I've said I will do and when I will get them done by, stick to the healthy meal plan I've developed, stick to strict bed times to ensure I'm getting enough good sleep and to put kindness, sincerity and curiosity at the forefront of all that I do.

            <h2>Foundations</h2>
            <p>
                My journey at Dev Academy started with a big picture goal of one day being able to work from home. It's important to note at this point that I've only recently been diagnosed with ADHD which has changed my entire view of the way that I am able to work. In a classic 9-5 work setting I had a lot of problems with long periods of really strong work, followed by intense periods of stress and misery. My main goal in pursuing a career in tech is to be able to have a little extra control over when I work, how I work and the way that work is presented. From a career-pathway perspective I'd like to eventually get into team management, I enjoy management and think my leadership and people-skills are some of my greatest strengths. When I am managing a team I get a great sense of joy and achievement out of managing each member in a unique way, creating a management relationship that is beneficial and personally relevant for both of us. I like to think of myself as somewhat of a social chameleon, finding things in common with just about anybody and managing to form a positive relationship based on those commonalities. I have a strong sense of integrity and compassion which means I work well in a team environment, but I'm also a strong creative problem-solver, I'm happy to work autonomously and I hold myself and my work to a high personal standard. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I do struggle if I'm being managed too closely, or if I feel like I'm being analysed by those around me, particularly as one of my major limitations is my sensitivity to harsh criticism. I have a perfectionist streak and hold myself to a high standard so direct criticism is more likely to alienate me than inspire me to achieve higher. This becomes a problem when I get carried away in tasks I'm enjoying, over-absorbing myself and letting other priorities slip a little. This has been a major point of contention in my work life to this point. Capacity to focus over long periods while avoiding over-focusing is something I'd like to work at while at Dev Academy. If I'm under-focused I get fidgety and have trouble sitting still, if I'm over-focused I forget everything else that's going around me. This ties in closely with another skill I'd like to learn which is being able to sit and continue working while in a state of overwhelmed confusion. When I hit a mental blockade I automatically default to fidgety-child and want to move around the place and look at other things, I'm working very hard to try and reframe the way that I deal with these moments over my dev journey. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to manage my workload I therefore aim to deal with blocks by taking a strictly timed walking-break if things become overwhelming. I will remind myself to take time to process any negative feedback given and respond in a thought-out way, absorbing the feedback in a helpful and constructive manner. I will maintain keeping the slack channel open while I'm working to keep an eye on the dev academy bigger picture and to maintain open communication with my student peers and the academy facilitators. I'll ensure that any emergency changes to my plans or schedule are communicated asap with facilitators and any other students I'm currently working with. I will continue to track my time with toggl to ensure I'm keeping a steady pace through the day and to keep an eye on my own working patterns. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My expectations of the facilitators mostly revolve around understanding that each student is different. I would expect them to remain open-minded and supportive to their cohorts while also delivering any relevant constructive feedback in a manner that fits the person receiving it. I would appreciate not being over-managed if I'm meeting goals, but also to be supported in finding new ways to do things if I'm not meeting expectations. Overall I expect the facilitators to be mentors and co-workers, learning as well as teaching, and to maintain all the values and integrity that Dev Academy is so strong in. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If I'm in need of help I will maintain a first-response tactic of googling solidly, but if I remain blocked on something for over an hour I will ensure that I will ask other student before turning to facilitators. If I need any personal help I have a strong relationship with my doctor and psychologist and I am strongly aware that they are both still an important part of my career journey at this point in time too. There are times when I may need to factor psych appointments into my work schedule, but I aim to always have as much notice as possible for these appointments and limit them to necessity.
