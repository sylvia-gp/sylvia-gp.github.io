                EQ is a term that is short for Emotional Intelligence. It is used to measure how a person processes and deals with emotions. EQ is a measure of how you deal with both your own emotional state and input, and how well you deal with the emotions of others. In regards to yourself EQ is about how you perceive your own emotions as well as how you then evaluate and express them outwardly. When looked at in regard to others then EQ is about your ability to use empathy and perceive emotions in others, as well as using those perceptions to dictate how you relate to other people. High EQ helps to ease social communications and leads to a more level and secure view of the self.

                This is different to IQ as IQ is generally defined by testing people against their own age group in skills such as quantative reasoning, working memory, spatial understanding and fluid reasoning. This means that IQ has more to do with an individuals ability to understand and process reasoning concepts and logic, where EQ has more to with understanding people and their emotions. At this stage IQ is probably the more commonly known intelligence factor however EQ is a concept on the rise, particularly in more modern and forward-thinking work environments.

                This is important because people with high EQ tend to have more successful and satisfying careers in general, being far more likely to display good leadership qualities. Higher EQ tends to lead to more people liking and taking an interest in you, which in the long term is more likely to build an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect between co-workers. On a personal front a higher EQ also leads to greater understanding of self, which in turn leads to a happier and more grounded perspective and a more open-minded outlook on life. Making an effort to understand human emotion simply makes you a happier, more likeable and more well-rounded person!
